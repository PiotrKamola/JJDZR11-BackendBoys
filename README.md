<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

User Registration:
John, a park enthusiast, heard about ZgubaApp from a friend. He decides to registers as a new user by providing his email and creating a password.

Reporting a Lost Item:
One day, while John is at the local park, he realizes that he lost his favorite sunglasses. He quickly opens the ZgubaApp and clicks on the "Report Lost Item" button.

Item Details:
John fills in the details of the lost item, including a description of the sunglasses, the location where he last had them (the park), and the date when he noticed them missing.

Submission:
After completing the form, John clicks the "Submit" button, and the app registers his lost item report in the database.

Community Alert:
The app automatically sends a community alert to other users in the vicinity of the park, notifying them about the lost sunglasses.

User Interaction:
Sarah, another user of ZgubaApp, receives the alert and recalls seeing a pair of sunglasses matching the description in the park earlier that day. She decides to check if they are still there.

Finding the Lost Item:
Sarah goes to the park and uses the app's "Advanced Search" feature to filter lost items reported in the last 24 hours. She quickly spots the sunglasses at the exact location mentioned in the app.

Notifying the Owner:
Sarah clicks on the "Found" button next to the lost item entry in the app, which triggers a notification to John that his sunglasses have been found.

Reuniting the Owner with the Lost Item:
John receives the notification and contacts Sarah through the app's private messaging feature. They agree to meet at the park, and Sarah happily returns the sunglasses to John.

Community Success:
John expresses his gratitude to Sarah, and both users feel a sense of fulfillment in being part of a community that helps reunite lost items with their rightful owners.

App Engagement:
John continues to use ZgubaApp regularly to report lost items he finds and to help others in the community recover their belongings.
ZgubaApp's platform successfully facilitated the process of finding and returning lost items, creating a supportive community dedicated to reuniting lost possessions with their owners.
